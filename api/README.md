# tests for different things

### APOD
NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day api thing

### Discord
uses [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) to make a discord profile
has spotify and twitch activity
- *half of it doesnt work anymore anyway since yknow its a test and ive used it on my main site now*

### Dynamic Weather
fetches co-ordinates from a json file,
then fetches weather info based on those co-ordinates
- made this incase i wanted *really* local weather on my site
- so if i were in another country, the weather for that country/region would display instead
